### Movie as an Object

Let's create a movie object based on the data structure we used in [Homework #2](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2/blob/master/homework/week-2-homework.playground/Contents.swift). 

Instructions:
1. Make a Movie.swift file.
2. Create a `Movie` class using variables as existing types with default values.
3. Populate an array of `Movie` objects converted from the familiar array of dictionaries.
